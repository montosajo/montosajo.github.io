# EthCrow
EthCrow is a decentralized escrow service utilizing the Ethereum blockchain and its smart contract abilities. EthCrow allows users to create an escrow transaction to anyone with an Ethereum wallet address that can be resolved with a deadline when the receiver can withdraw, finalization of the transaction by the sender, or a refund by the receiver. In the case of a dispute, the sender may add days to the deadline, though neither sender nor receiver can withdraw unless the other has given their permission, except in the case that the deadline has been passed in which the receiver may withdraw the Ether.
